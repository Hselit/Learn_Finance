        <h2>Financial System</h2>
        <p>
        The financial system is like a network that helps money and resources move around in an economy. It includes banks, markets, rules, and mechanisms that make it easier for people and businesses to save, borrow, invest, and exchange money. It also includes organizations that keep an eye on the system to make sure things are fair and stable. Financial institutions, like banks and insurance companies, are part of the system. They help people save money, give out loans, and provide other financial services. Financial markets, such as the stock market, bond market, and currency market, are places where people buy and sell things like company shares, bonds, and foreign currencies. Rules and regulations are important to keep the system fair and safe. There are organizations that make and enforce these rules to protect people and make sure everyone follows the same standards. Payment systems are also part of the financial system. They help people transfer money between each other, like when you pay for something using a credit card or make an online payment. Overall, the financial system helps people manage their money, invest in businesses, and make the economy work. It's like a big network that connects everyone and everything related to money in an organized way.

        <li>
        <h4>Short Tenure (less than 1 year)</h4>
        
        <h5>Money Market:</h5><p class="indent"> Deals with short-term borrowing and lending of funds, typically for periods of one year or less. It includes instruments such as Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements. Example: Investing in a 3-month Treasury bill issued by the government.</p>

        <h5>Exchange-Traded Market:</h5><p class="indent"> A marketplace where people can buy and sell financial products like stocks, bonds, commodities, and derivatives. It's a centralized location with regulated and organized trading. Prices are public, and fair trading practices are ensured. Examples include stock exchanges and commodity exchanges.</p>
        </li>

These contracts specify the delivery of an underlying asset at a predetermined future date and price. Parties involved agree to buy or sell the asset on a specified future date, regardless of the current market price at that time. Futures contracts are traded on exchanges with standardized terms and conditions (including quantity, quality, and delivery date).</p> <p>Example: A farmer entering a futures contract to sell a certain quantity of corn to a buyer at a predetermined price and delivery date. The transaction will be settled at the agreed-upon future date, regardless of the current market price of corn.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Commodity Market</h5>
        <p class="indent">The Commodity Market deals with buying and selling of raw materials like gold, oil, agricultural products, and industrial metals.  Here, you might purchase gold bullion as a hedge against inflation or trade contracts for crude oil futures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Cryptocurrency Market</h5>
        <p class="indent">The Cryptocurrency Market involves buying and selling digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. These cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks using blockchain technology, allowing secure and direct transactions between individuals (peer-to-peer).  An example is buying Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).</p>

<h2>Intrinsic Value Calculation</h2>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Intrinsic value represents the present value of the expected future cash flows generated by a company, adjusted for the time value of money and the perceived risk associated with the investment.</p>

<h4>Formula (DCF method)</h4>
<p>
<i>Intrinsic Value = (CF1 / (1+r)^1) + (CF2 / (1+r)^2) + ... + (CFn / (1+r)^n)</i>
</p>
<p>
Where:

CF1, CF2, ..., CFn = Expected future cash flows for each period (usually years)
r = Discount rate, representing the desired rate of return or the minimum acceptable return for the investment
</p>
<p>Example
Let's assume a company is expected to generate the following annual cash flows over the next five years: ₹10,000, ₹15,000, ₹20,000, ₹25,000, and ₹30,000. The discount rate is determined to be 10%.
</p>

    <p><i>Intrinsic Value = (₹10,000 / (1+0.10)^1) + (₹15,000 / (1+0.10)^2) + (₹20,000 / (1+0.10)^3) + (₹25,000 / (1+0.10)^4) + (₹30,000 / (1+0.10)^5)</i>

    </p><p><i>
    Intrinsic Value = ₹9,090.91 + ₹12,396.69 + ₹16,530.00 + ₹20,752.89 + ₹24,835.86
    </i></p>
    <p><i>
    Intrinsic Value = ₹83,606.45
    </i></p>
<p>Based on the DCF analysis, the intrinsic value of the company's stock is estimated to be ₹83,606.45. If the current market price of the stock is significantly lower than the calculated intrinsic value, it may indicate that the stock is undervalued and potentially a good investment opportunity.</p>
